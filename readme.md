# Face Change using DeepFaceLab - Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the process of changing faces using DeepFaceLab, a popular deep learning framework for face manipulation. It provides step-by-step instructions and code snippets for face extraction, alignment, training, conversion, and merging using DeepFaceLab.

## Prerequisites

- DeepFaceLab: Ensure DeepFaceLab is properly installed and set up with the required models and directories.
- Jupyter Notebook: Have Jupyter Notebook installed to run the Face_Change.ipynb file.

## Usage

1. Clone the DeepFaceLab repository and navigate to the directory containing the Face_Change.ipynb file.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the Face_Change.ipynb notebook.
3. Follow the instructions and execute each code cell sequentially to perform face swapping.
4. View the output images and intermediate results generated during the process.
